# Modifications to Various Machery-Nagel Kits

## Nucleo-Spin Kit

Submitted by Allie Greaney.

- Always keep the lid on buffer NT3 (the wash buffer) very tight - etoh evaporation will mess you up
- Add the buffer NT3 by running pipette tip around rim of column to wash thoroughly. 
- I use a bit more buffer NT1 (the binding buffer) than recommended (200-500uL for a 100mg gel slice)
- 2 (or 3) washes, 90s max speed dry spin
- For DNA fragments >1kb, increase yields by pre-heating the elution water or EB to 70C. Add 15-30uL water to membrane. Incubate 50C, 5 min. Can repeat elution with fresh water/EB to increase yields.
