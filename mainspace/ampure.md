# Protocol for using AmPure Beads for DNA Clean-Up

Submitted by Kate Crawford and Rachel Eguia. 

## Reagents Needed

- FRESHLY made 70% EtOH
- EB
- AmPure beads, room temperature
- reagent reservoirs
- 96-well PCR plate magnet block

## Protocol

1. Take bead aliquot (X ml) from vortexed stock and allow to come to room temperature
  - aliquot should be 1:1 volume for your DNA sample. Ex. 40 uL sample, add 40 uL beads
2. Add X ul beads to each well and mix 20x.
3. Incubate at RT for 10 minutes to bind.
4. Put on magnet for 5 minutes.
5. Aspirate (try to aspirate a volume that is ~5 ul less than the total volume).
6. While leaving on the magnet, Wash twice with 180ul fresh 80% ethanol. 
  - (I personally do this by Adding and then immediately removing the 180ul of ethanol for the first wash, and then for the second wash i set the pipetter to ~160ul and add 160ul of ethanol and then depress the pipetter all the way so that i can suck up ~200ul worth to completely remove any residual ethanol).
7. Air dry ~10 min.
8. While keeping the plate still on the magnet, Add X ul EB (typically works best 60 or more ul)
9. Remove from rack slowly dragging the bead pellet back into solution - then, now that the plate is OFF the rack, resuspend all wells by pipetting 10x, until the beads are fully resuspended
10. Incubate 5 min to resuspend DNA
11. Put on magnet for 5 minutes
12. Transfer bead-free DNA solutions to a new plate.
