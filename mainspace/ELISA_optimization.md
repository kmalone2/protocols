# Protocol for ELISA Optimization

Submitted by Lauren Gentles. 

When setting up an ELISA with a new protein antigen or primary antibody, the amount of protein used to coat the plate (for a standard ELISA) or the amount of capture antibody (for a sandwich ELISA) should be optimized in order to produce good signal with low noise without wasting excess reagents. The primary antibody should also be optimized for these same reasons. The following protocol explains how to do this, but the general ELISA method can be applied once the parameters have been determined. This protocol is based on the Bethyl Labs ELISA system and their full protocol can be found here: https://www.bethyl.com/content/protocol_elisa_p1.

**Safety Considerations**: 


## Reagents

- Thermo Fisher Clear Flat-Bottom Immuno Nonsterile 96-Well Plates
- Antigen (preferably purified)
- HRP-Conjugated Primary Antibody
- Coating Buffer, 0.05 M Carbonate-Bicarbonate, pH 9.6 (do not dissolve outer capsule when making this buffer) 
- Wash Solution, 50 mM Tris, 0.14 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0
- Blocking (Postcoat) Solution, 50 mM Tris, 0.14 M NaCl, 1% BSA, pH 8.0
- Conjugate Diluent, 50 mM Tris, 0.14 M NaCl, 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0
- Enzyme Substrate, TMB
- 1M HCl Stop solution

## Method

1.	In high binding ELISA plates, add 100ul of coating buffer to all wells except column 1. To column 1, add 1ug of coating antigen and bring the total volume up to 200ul with coating buffer. Make 2-fold dilutions across the plate by moving 100ul from column 1 to column 2, etc. Stop at column 11 leaving column 12 as a no antigen negative control to measure the background signal of the assay.
2.	Incubate the plate at room temp for at least 1 hour or at 4C overnight.
3.	Wash the plate 5x with ELISA wash buffer.
4.	Add 100ul of blocking buffer to all wells and incubate at room temp for at least 1 hour or overnight at 4C.
5.	Wash plate 5x.
6.	Add 100ul of conjugate diluent to all wells except row A. To row A, add 100ug of detection antibody (this may be excessive for high affinity antibodies) and bring the total volume up to 200ul with conjugate diluent. Make 2-fold dilutions down the plate by moving 100ul from row A to row B etc.
7.	Incubate plate for at least 1 hour at room temp.
8.	Wash plate 5x.
9.	Add 100ul of the appropriate HRP-conjugated detection antibody at a 1:100,000 dilution in blocking buffer (for Bethyl Lab antibodies but other HRP antibodies can be similarly diluted) to all wells.
10.	Incubate plate for at least 1 hour at room temp.
11.	Wash plate 5x.
12.	Add 100ul of TMB solution to each well and allow the assay to develop for 10min.
  - Assay development time may need to be optimized to give best signal. Determine a time that produces strong but not saturated signal and use this precise time for all plates.
13.	Add 100ul of Stop solution to stop the reaction and read on a plate reader with an excitation wave length of 450nm.

## Analysis

Subtract the no antigen background signal from all values and plot data with respect to antigen concentration and primary antibody amount. Determine the concentration of each parameter that falls at the high end of the linear range of detection for use in future assays.
