# Protocol for Standard Lithium Acetate Transformation of Yeast

Submitted by Tyler Starr. 

## Reagents Needed

- YPD (500mL) liquid and agar media
	- 10g bacto peptone
	- 5g yeast extract
	- (12g bacto agar for plates)
	- To 450mL with water
	- Autoclave
	- While cooling, add 50mL sterile 20% glucose
	- (For YPAD, add 20mg powdered adenine hemisulfate prior to autoclave)
- SD-CAA selective growth media (500mL)
	- 3.35g YNB
	- 2.5g Casamino acids
	- 1.065g MES
	- (12g agar for plates)
	- Bring to 450mL H2O
  - (Check that pH hits 5.3 – exact pH not important since not buffered – I believe you just want media acidic to inhibit bacterial contamination)
	- Autoclave
	- While cooling, add 50mL sterile sugar solution (20% Dex for SD-CAA) (or add for each use)
- Salmon sperm DNA (carrier DNA for yeast transformation)
	- 250mg ssDNA
	- 125mL sterile 1xTE
	- Break up by pipetting with large bore 50mL pipette
	- Stir at 4oC overnight
	- Aliquot and freeze -20oC
- 10x TE, pH 8.0 (100mM Tris, 10mM EDTA) (1L)
	- 12.114 g Tris base
	- Fill with H2O, pH to 8.0
	- Add 20mL 0.5M EDTA, pH 8.0
	- Fill to 1L
	- Autoclave
- 1M LiAc (100mL)
	- 10.2g lithium acetate
	- 100mL H2O
	- Autoclave (15min) or sterile filter
- PEG MW 3350 50% w/v (100mL)
	- 50g PEG 3350
	- Add ~30mL H2O, stir in beaker to dissolve (can use gentle heat)
	- Bring to 100mL with H2O
  - Sterile filter (takes a while!)
	- Store RT, well capped! (Evaporation bad)

## Protocol

### Day 1

1. Restreak yeast strain (e.g. EBY100 or AWY101 for yeast display) from glycerol stock onto YPD agar plate (or use a previous restreak kept at 4˚C, up to two months or so in fridge should be fine)

### Day 2

2. Start overnight culture in 1.5mL YPD, 30˚C shaker (make two overnights if backdiluting to >100mL in subsequent step)

### Day 3

3. Back dilute culture to 0.25 OD in YPD. Use 5mL of culture per transformation.
4. Grow at 30˚C for two doublings (1 OD), which takes ~3.5-4 hours (if YPD is pre-warmed to 30˚C beforehand, can be 3-3.5hrs)
5. While culture is growing, prep transformation reagents:
  - 0.1M Lithium Acetate/1xTE: need 2mL + 100uL per reaction, plus dead volume. This can be prepped at 50mL scale and seems to last ~indefinitely for multiple transformations 
  - 40%PEG/0.1M LiAc/1xTE: need 600uL per reaction, plus dead volume. This should be prepped fresh for each transformation (reuse over the course of a couple days probably fine). Note: 50% PEG stock concentration can change over time as water evaporates – if a transformation fails unexpectedly, the first place to look is usually to prep fresh 50% PEG. But, if capped tightly, my 50% PEG solutions don’t go off for several years.
  - Pull an aliquot of DMSO, 70uL/rxn plus dead volume, into an Eppendorf to have ready
  - Boil salmon sperm DNA >95˚C 5min, return to ice. (Can use previously boiled salmon sperm DNA for ~5 freeze thaws without needing to re-boil).
  - Aliquot DNA: make an Eppendorf tube for each tfn, add 2uL boiled+cooled salmon sperm DNA, and 2-5uL plasmid DNA
6. Once culture has grown to OD ~1, pour culture into 50mL conicals, spin 2k rpm 10 min, pour off supernatant
7. Resuspend each pellet in 1mL 0.1M LiOAc/1x TE, and transfer to Eppendorf
8. Spin at 10k rpm, 20s, pipette off supernatant
9. Resuspend in 0.1M LiOAc/1x TE to total 100uL/transformation, aliquot 100uL per transformation tube containing DNA
10. Add 600uL 40%PEG/0.1M LiOAc/1x TE, vortex briefly
11. (Optional, incubate 30oC for 30min – I don’t do this)
12. Add 70uL DMSO, immediately mix by inverting several times, flicking tube to mix
13. Heat shock at 42˚C for 15-30min
14. Cool on ice ~1-2 minutes
15. Spin cells, top speed, 20-30s, aspirate supernatant
16. Resuspend in 200uL sterile H2O or media
17. Plate on selective medium (e.g. SD-CAA if selecting for Trp auxotrophy)
  - If doing just a couple transformations, easy to plate the whole 200uL per plate
  - If doing many transformations, I usually will pipette a bunch of 5uL spots onto a grid on one or two plates and let absorb/evaporate. Depending on downstream purpose, if you want to sample 3 independent transformants, I will usually plate >3 5uL-spots per transformation, so I can restreak each spot independently and assure independent transformants
18. Incubate plates 30˚C. Colonies generally start to appear at the end of day 2, waiting until day 3-4 (e.g. over a weekend) is fine
19. If needed, restreak to single colony resolution
