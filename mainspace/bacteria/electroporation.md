# Protocol for transformation of E. coli by Electroporation

Submitted by Allie Greaney.

Also includes setting up a test plate for calculating transformation yield and CFU.

## Reagents Needed
- AmPure Beads
- Electroporation cuvettes
- 1.5 mL epi tubes
- E. coli (NEB 10-beta)
- ice
- SOC (prewarmed to 37˚C)
- selective media 
- electroporator

## Protocol

### Ampure Purification of DNA

1. Ampure the DNA (must be very pure for electroporation to work) 
2. Bring DNA/Gibson volume up to 50uL with water
3. Added a 1:1 ratio of beads to DNA (50 uL + 50uL)
4. Eluted in 20 uL water (NOT EB!)

### Test transformation – electroporation
5. It is very important that everything stay COLD!!!
6. Put cuvettes, 1.5mL Epp tubes, E. coli NEB 10-beta cells on ice (need 20uL/rxn, each tube has 100uL).
7. Put 2mL Epp tubes on rack nearby.
8. Warm SOC to 37C (will need 500uL per each)
9. Add 1uL of DNA to Epp tube
10. Then add 20uL of thawed cells. Then walk over to electroporator. Do the next steps one sample at a time. 
11. Transfer 20uL of this to the cuvette, between the plates (use the p10/20 tips). NO BUBBLES!
12. Get 500uL warmed SOC ready in pipette
13. Working quickly, shock cells at 1.8kV. The time should hopefully read >5ms.
14. When done, quickly add 500uL SOC, pipette up and down, and transfer to new 2mL Epp tube.
15. Outgrowth for 30-60 minutes (Danny says 1h is preferred) 
16. Then I diluted the cells: 1uL cells + 199 uL SOC.
17. I also did a 1:10 dilution of this by adding 20 uL of ^^ + 180 uL SOC
18. Then I plated 50 uL
19. So I effectively plated 0.25uL and 0.025uL of out-grown transformation
