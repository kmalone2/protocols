# Protocol for the Chemical Transformation of E. Coli

# Stellar Cells

Submitted by Allie Greaney.

## Reagents Needed
- DNA
- Stellar cells
- Heat block
- selective media
- 2 mL epi tube
- ice

## Protocol

- Do not use >10ng DNA* per 50uL Stellar cells. This means:
  - 2uL of a 20uL Gibson assembly (assuming ~100ng DNA in the assembly)  + 50uL cells, or 
  - 1uL of a 10uL assembly + 50uL cells
  - 1uL of a 20uL assembly + 25uL cells 
  - 0.5uL of 10uL assembly + 25uL cells
  - etc
*Using too much DNA will dramatically decrease yields.*

1. Add DNA to 2mL eppendorf tube (this works better because the tube is wider at the bottom than the 1.5mL tubes). 
2. Add cells. 
3. Ice for 30 min
4. Heat shock 42C for 60s in the heat block near Andrea’s bench (according to Clontech website, 45s is recommended when using 14mL culture tubes, and 60s recommended for 2mL epp tubes)
5. Ice 2min
6. Outgrowth not necessary for Amp

# Stbl3 Cells

Submitted by Keara Malone

## Reagents Needed
- DNA 
- Stbl3 cells
- thermocycler or heat block
- ice
- 1.5 mL epi tubes
- prewarmed SOC
- prewarmed selective media

## Protocol

1. Thaw Stbl3s on ice
2. To epi tubes (or PCR tubes), add 1 uL DNA (can be a plasmid or infusion product, etc)
3. Add 15 uL Stbl3s per reaction

Note: I have used the thermocycler for the following steps really successfully, but you can do this manually if needed

4. Incubate on ice 30 minutes (30 m at 4˚C)
5. Heat shock at 42˚C for 45s 
6. Incubate on ice 2 minutes (2m at 4˚C)
7. Immediately add prewarmed SOC (50 uL-250 uL, depending on amount of DNA transformed. For plasmids, add 250 uL. For in-Fusion product, add 50 uL)
8. Plate either the entire volume (if added 50 uL previously) or 100 uL of transformation on prewarmed selective media
  - you can allow these to recover for up to 60m, but have had good success with no recovery
