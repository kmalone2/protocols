# Practices and Procedures for Commonly Used Cell Lines 

The Bloom Lab uses a variety of cell lines for virus work. Below is a list of the different types of cells, along with key information for maintenance and care.

## 293T

This is an adherent cell line. From human embryonic kidney cells, so commonly referred to as 239T, 293s, HEKs, etc. 

Shape: 
- when healthy, these cells look spiky/round

Media:
- maintained in D10

Splitting:
- typically split every 2-3 days, maintaining a minimum of 10% confluency. 

Uses: 
- transfections
- transductions
- infection
- protein production
- titering influenza/lentivirus

## TZM-bl

This is an adherent cell line. These are HeLa cells transduced with CD4 and CCR5, so infectable by HIV.

Shape:
- mostly triangular

Media:
- maintained in D10

Splitting:
- typically split every 2.5-3 days, maintaining a minimum of ~15% confluency
- when uninfected, can be kept in the BL2 tissue culture room

Uses:
- HIV neutralization assays
- HIV titering
- HIV virus production

## SupT1.R5

This is a suspended cell line. These are human T-cells isolated from a patient with lymphoblastic lymphoma. Infectable by HIV.

Shape:
- round, but grow in clumps. When ready to split, the clumps are typically visible to the naked eye.

Media:
- maintained in R10

Splitting:
- typically split every 2.5-3 days. Split most often to a concentration of 2.5e5 cells/mL as counted on the Countess or manually (using a hemacytometer)
- split when cell concentration reaches ~2e6 cells/mL when maintaining this line
- in the past, have had variable luck with accurate counting using the Countess cell counter. This is likely because the Trypan blue dye stains these cells differently than other cells, so we have seen that the cell counter *overestimates* the percentage of dead cells. 
- mix VERY well before counting with the cell counter. Verify by eye using the microscope that clumps of cells have been broken up before counting/adding trypan blue. Likely, it is trypan blue getting stuck in the clumps of cells that causes the overestimation of dead cells when counting using the Countess. 

Uses:
- HIV DMS library passaging
- HIV DMS library selections

## MDCK

This is an adherent cell line. These are cells isolated from canine kidney cells. 

Shape:

Media:
- maintained in D10

Splitting:
- typically split every 1.5-2 days, as these cells grow quite quickly.
- they are extremely adherent, and require incubation with trypsin at 37ËšC for longer than most other cell lines

Uses:
- influenza virus production
- influenza neutralization assays

# Other cell lines

There are a variety of cell lines used in the Bloom lab that are not in regular use. Those are as follows:

## Vero (E6)

This is an adherent cell line. These are from African Green Monkey kidney cells. 

Shape:
- elongate 

Splitting:
- typically split every 2 days

Media:
- maintained in D10
