# Protocol for Neutralization Assays of HIV

This is a protocol for HIV neutralization assays (full length and pseudovirus). This can be done for serum, antibodies, or antiretrovirals. Submitted by Keara Malone. See an attached example of a neutralization assay.

Safety Considerations: 

HIV (both full length and pseudovirus) is a BL2/3 level pathogen. All steps in which virus is introduced or present in the media must be performed in the BL2+ space, with all relevant protocols. 

## Required Materials

- Corning black polystyrene 96-well flat bottom plates with clear lid
- D10
- DEAE-dextran
- TZM-bl cells
- GalScreen reagents
- serum/antibody/antiretroviral drug to test 

## Protocol

### Day 1

1. Check TZM-bl cells. A 15cm fully confluent dish should be enough for up to 14 plates of neutralization assays at once.
2. Transition to the BL2+ lab. Bring down D10 and neutralization assay plates. 
3. Begin setting up the neutralization plates for serum dilutions. 
  - Make up a serum/antibody starting dilution *at double concentration* to the intended starting dilution (called 4x dilution). You will dilute it by 2 when adding the virus. There are several different ways to do these serum dilutions.
  - ** 2-fold dilutions **: Add 25 uL media to columns 4-12.  Add 50 uL of serum or antibody/media dilution (double conc the first dilution to be tested) to column 3. serial dilute 25 uL down the plate (mixing, using same tips) (25 uL into 25 uL media. Make sure to take 25 uL out of last row (so 25 uL total is in each well). 
  - ** 3-fold dilutions **: Add 25 uL media to columns 4-12. Add 37.5 uL serum/media 4x dilution into column three, then serially dilute 12.5 uL down plate, removing 12.5 uL at the end.
  - ** 4-fold dilutions **: Add 25 uL media to columns 4-12. Add 33.33 uL serum/media 4x dilution to column three, then dilute 8.33 uL into 25 all the way down, removing 8.33 uL at the end. 
4. The dilutions can be done in a separate dilution plate, or in the actual neutralization plates. If done in the neutralization plates, be extremely cognizant of bubbles, as it will be difficult to remove them.
  - Here is an example I've done in the past of doing the dilutions in the actual neutralization plate:
  - I will make up 3 fold dilutions x4.5 plates x2 duplicate columns then stamp 25 uL to two duplicate columns of 4.5 total plates (all having the same serum setup but different viruses). I will dilute the duplicate columns seperately in x4.5 volumes on the dilution plate. Thus, I will end up needing 37.5 uL times 4.5 plates = 168.75 uL total in row 3 wells of dilution plate. I will make the master serum working dilution once, so I need OVER 168.75*2=337.5uL. I will make 350 uL total of working dilution in a 1.5mL epi, then add 168.75 uL twice to the duplicate row C wells on the dilution plate. To rows D-H, I will add 25 uL * 4.5 plates = 112.5 uL of media. I will then dilute 12.5 * 4.5 = 56.25 uL of ab down into 112.5 uL of media. I will change tips each time, and pipette mix 10x. Then, I will stamp 25 uL in a column specific fashion to each row of neut assay plates (we will have 0.5 plate worth left over). 
5. After setting up the dilution plates, you will next add virus. Add 500 infectious particles per well.
6. Incubate at 37˚C for 1h
7. During the incubation, return to the BL2 space and count and trypsinize (harvest) the TZM-bl cells. 
8. Return to the BL2+ space with the cells. Add DEAE-dextran just before adding the cells.
  - if using FULL-LENGTH virus, add DEAE-dextran to a final concentration of 100 ug/mL in a final volume of 150 uL 
  - if using PSEUDOVIRUS, add DEAE-dextran to a final concentration of 10 ug/mL in a final volume of 150 uL
9. Add 100 uL of cells containing 1e5 cells to each well
10. Incubate at 37˚C for 48hours

### Day 3

11. 48 hpi, prepare to read the plates.
  - turn off the lights in the nook by the plate reader and turn it on
12. Take both GalScreen reagents out of the fridge and allow to come to room temperature for 10 minutes.
  - turn off the lights in the hood
13. Make a 1:25 dilution of GalScreen substrate to GalScreen buffer A. Protect from light
14. Remove 85 uL media from the plates.
15. Add 50 uL GalScreen mix to each well
16. Incubate for exactly 50 minutes in the dark
17. Read on the plate reader. There is a file on the computer with a protocol to use it. 
18. Process and plot using Prism GraphPad
