This file contains two protocols: production of HIV full length virus and HIV pseudovirus. These are both protocols done in the BL2+ space, which we share with the Emerman and Overbaugh labs. You must be specially trained to work in this space, and ALL reagents that could be considered infectious must be worked with in that lab space. Be aware that nothing is allowed to come out of that lab space once it enters, including racks, tubes, cells, reagents, etc. Do not take any Bloom lab racks into that space (they MUST stay in the antechamber).

# Protocol for Production of HIV

## Reagents needed: 

- DMEM (**not D10**)
- FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Promega)
- plasmid
  - FL: 2 ug HIV-genome encoding plasmid
  - PSV: 0.6 ug backbone plasmid (HIV genome ∆Env) and 1.6 ug Env encoding plasmid
- 6-well TC treated plate
- microcentrifuge tubes (1.7 mL)
- syringes (5 or 10 mL, depending on how many wells for each virus)
- 0.20 um syringe filters
- 15 mL conical tubes
- cryo-tubes with an internal O-ring (National Scientific™ BioStor™ Screw Cap Vials, Skirted*)

*these take a LONG time to come in. Order well in advance (one-two months ish)

## Protocol

### Day 1
1. Seed 293Ts in the 6 well plate at a density of 4-5e5 cells per well. Add 2 mL cells per well.
    - this is variable depending on what works for you individually. The transfections work best when the cells are 50-70% confluent on the day of transfections

### Day 2
2. In the Bloom Lab TC space, make a master mix of room-temperature FuGENE 6 and DMEM. Add DMEM first, then FuGENE. Mix well.

Reagent | Volume per 1 well (uL)
--- | ---
DMEM | 94
FuGENE 6 | 6

3. Aliquot plasmid DNA in microcentrifuge tubes.
4. Take these and your confluent cells to the BL2+ lab.
5. In the BL2+ lab, add 100 uL of the DMEM/FuGENE mix to the microcentrifuge tubes. 
6. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min
7. Dropwise and in a circular fashion, add the transfection mix to the cells.

### Day 4 or 5

8. 48-72 hours post transfection, harvest virus.
9. Aspirate cell supernatant using the syringe.
10. Attach a syringe filter to the syringe.
11. Filter the supernatant into the 15 mL conical. Mix extremely well.
12. Aliquot 500 uL into cryo-tubes, also making sure to aliquot 50 uL into a cryo-tube for titering.
13. Store at -80˚C
