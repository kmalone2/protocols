# Protocol for TCID50 of Flu

Submitted by Allie Greaney on behalf of Sarah Hilton.

Safety Considerations:

- Cryotubes of virus go into the tip collection
- plate with virus is taped, sealed in a ziplock bag (taped),
and put into the biohazard bin

## Reagents Needed
- TC-treated 90-well plate
- 12 channel multichannel pipette
- Wescodyne solution
- recepticle for virus contaminated waste
- IGM
- D10
- virus

## Protocol

### Set-up
1. 6 replicates/virus
2. columns 1 and 12 cells only
3. Discard remaining thawed virus as titer will be different after freezing
4. Prepare Wescodyne, rack for 4 conical tubes, orange rack/red biohazard bags, box for transferring viruses, 500 mL bottle for media.
5. Aliquot D10 (neutralize, resuspend for new plate), trypsin, and PBS for splitting cells.

### Protocol
6. Thaw viruses (15’-20’) pipet up/down 2x before use
7. Prepare IGM
8. 10 mL IGM/plate
9. 20 mL to resuspend MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2 cells
10. Aliquot IGM and put in the incubator
11. Add 90 ul of media to each well in the plate and verify by the eye
12. ** Initial Virus dilution **
13. On a separate 96 well plate make a virus row
14. Add 180 ul IGM to each well and 20 ul virus to each well
15. Mix well
16. This is a 1:10 dilution of the virus stock
17. Add virus to plate
18. Add 10 ul of 1:10 dilution to row A of each plate
19. Mix 10 times
20. Viral dilutions
21. Transfer 10 ul of virus to next row
22. Make sure there is virus in the pipet tip
23. Pipet up and down 10x while moving pipetman around
24. Change tips
25. Remove 10 ul from last row to keep volumes constant
26. **Prep cells**
27. Split MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2
28. Pellet cells
29. Resuspend in 20mL IGM
30. Create cell master mix at 1e5 cells/mL, need 5 mL per plate
31. Add cells
32. Mix diluted cells by inversion
33. Add 5.5 mL cells to a new reservoir
34. Add 50 ul to the middle of each well
35. Now each well has 5e3 cells
36. Pipet up/down 2x
37. Change tips for each row
38. Change reservoir after every 2 plates
39. Put cells in incubator
40. Clean up

### Day 3/4

Checking/scoring
41. Check cells after 48 hours (to see if you are even going to get a titer)
42. Score after 72 hours
