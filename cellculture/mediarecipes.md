## Media Recipes

These are recipes for the most commonly used media types in the lab. Please label all bottles of media with the type, your initials, and the date. When you use all of a bottle of media, please **rinse** the bottle in the sink before placing the empty, clean bottle in the cardboard boxes at the far end of the TC room.

### D10
Reagents Needed:
- DMEM
  - found in TC fridge or cold room
  - Corning brand
- 50 mL FBS
  - found in plasmid log freezer
- 5 mL Pen-strep (optional)
  - found in plasmid log freezer
- 5 mL L-Glutamine
  - found in plasmid log freezer
- 500 mL sterile filter bottle

Protocol:
1. Remove 50 mL DMEM from the 500 mL bottle. Reserve in a 50 mL conical for transfections
2. Pour 450 mL DMEM into the cup of the filter bottle, ensuring that the filter is securely screwed onto the mouth of the bottle
3. Pour 50 mL FBS into the DMEM
4. Pour or use a serological pipette to add the pen-strep and l-glutamine
5. Secure the vaccuum to the filter bottle
6. Apply vaccuum to filter sterilize media
7. Cap and store at 4˚C


### Fluorobrite D10
Reagents Needed:
- **Fluorobrite** DMEM
  - found in TC fridge or cold room
  - Gibco brand
- 50 mL FBS
  - found in plasmid log freezer
- 5 mL Pen-strep
  - found in plasmid log freezer
- 10 mL L-Glutamine
  - found in plasmid log freezer
- 500 mL sterile filter bottle

Protocol:
1. Remove 50 mL Fluorobrite DMEM from the 500 mL bottle.
2. Pour 450 mL Fluorobrite DMEM into the cup of the filter bottle, ensuring that the filter is securely screwed onto the mouth of the bottle
3. Pour 50 mL FBS into the DMEM
4. Pour or use a serological pipette to add the pen-strep and l-glutamine
5. Secure the vaccuum to the filter bottle
6. Apply vaccuum to filter sterilize media
7. Cap and store at 4˚C

### D10 for Tet-On Cells
Reagents Needed:
- DMEM
  - found in TC fridge or cold room
  - Corning brand
- 50 mL FBS
  - found in plasmid log freezer
- 5 mL Pen-strep (optional)
  - found in plasmid log freezer
- 5 mL L-Glutamine
  - found in plasmid log freezer
- 200 ug/mL G418 antibiotic
- 500 mL sterile filter bottle

Protocol:
1. Remove 50 mL DMEM from the 500 mL bottle. Reserve in a 50 mL conical for transfections if needed.
2. Pour 450 mL DMEM into the cup of the filter bottle, ensuring that the filter is securely screwed onto the mouth of the bottle
3. Pour 50 mL FBS into the DMEM
4. Pour or use a serological pipette to add the pen-strep, l-glutamine, and G418
5. Secure the vaccuum to the filter bottle
6. Apply vaccuum to filter sterilize media
7. Cap and store at 4˚C


### IGM (Influenza Growth Medium)

### NAM (Neutralization Assay Medium)

### R10
Reagents Needed:
- RPMI
  - buy as needed from the Media room on the E floor of the Thomas building
  - Gibco brand
- 50 mL FBS
  - special reservations of this are in the bottom of the freezer adjacent to the cold room
  - *keep track of lot number*
- 5 mL Pen-strep (optional)
  - found in plasmid log freezer
- 5 mL L-Glutamine
  - found in plasmid log freezer
- 500 mL sterile filter bottle

Protocol:
1. Pour 500 mL RPMI into the cup of the filter bottle, ensuring that the filter is securely screwed onto the mouth of the bottle. 
2. Secure the vaccuum to the filter bottle
3. Apply the vaccuum. While vaccuuming, add the remaining reagents (FBS, pen-strep, l-glutamine)
4. Cap and store at 4˚C
